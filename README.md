# QIP Overview

## Purpose
This repository provides a high-level overview of the **Quantova Improvement Proposal (QIP)**
framework and its role in the evolution of the Quantova protocol.

QIPs are formal design documents used to describe protocol behavior, architectural decisions,
and proposed changes in a structured and auditable manner. This repository explains the intent,
scope, and principles of the QIP system without defining specific proposals.

---

## What QIPs Are
A **Quantova Improvement Proposal (QIP)** is a technical specification or informational document
that captures design intent for the Quantova protocol and its associated systems.

QIPs are used to:
- Document protocol architecture and execution semantics
- Propose and review protocol changes
- Preserve rationale behind design decisions
- Provide long-term interpretability of the protocol

QIPs are **descriptive, not executable**.

---

## What QIPs Are Not
QIPs do not:
- Automatically change protocol behavior
- Represent deployed network upgrades
- Replace governance or validator decisions
- Function as application-layer standards

Acceptance of a QIP indicates agreement on design intent, not activation on a live network.

---

## Scope
QIPs may cover topics including:
- Core protocol behavior
- QVM execution and integration
- Registry and provenance semantics
- Cryptographic assumptions
- Governance processes
- Tooling and interoperability guidance

Each QIP is scoped to a **single topic** and maintained independently.

---

## Relationship to the Protocol
The Quantova protocol is defined by canonical network deployment and reference
implementations. QIPs provide a documented design layer that explains **why** the protocol
behaves as it does and **how** it may evolve.

Protocol upgrades are implemented through governance and deployment processes, not through
QIPs alone.

---

## Repository Role
This repository serves as a **conceptual overview** of the QIP system.

It does not contain individual proposals or specifications. Readers seeking concrete
specifications should refer to the relevant QIP repositories.

---

## Audience
This document is intended for:
- Protocol engineers
- Auditors and reviewers
- Governance participants
- Institutional and public-sector stakeholders
